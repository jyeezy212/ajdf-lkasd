ARTWORK REVIEW — FULL SOP TEMPLATE (TXT, Long Version, Region Inference Enabled)

PURPOSE
- Provide a single, enforceable standard for packaging & copy verification across Copy Doc and Artwork files.
- Ensure reviewers produce consistent, table-only outputs with zero prose drift.
- Prevent false flags by mandating a high-magnification “Zoom & Verify” pass before any issue is recorded.

USAGE
- Save this as a .txt file (UTF-8) and follow exactly. All outputs MUST use the schemas below.
- Preserve all emojis and symbols exactly as shown. Do not add or remove columns.

GLOBAL RULES (R)
R0 Preserve all emojis exactly as shown. Do not substitute or omit.
R1 Output ONLY the step header line plus the required table(s) or blocks—no extra prose before/after.
R2 Keep column headers and column order exactly as specified. Do not add columns unless a step explicitly allows “Add rows as needed.”
R3 Status icons: ✅ Match/Pass, ⚠️ Needs Attention, ❌ Fix Required. Use consistently across steps.
R4 Unknown values = “TBD”; use “Unspecified” only where explicitly indicated (e.g., Round/Version in Step 1).
R5 Quote source text exactly (punctuation, casing, accents/diacritics, hyphen vs en dash, apostrophes, trademark symbols); do not paraphrase in “Value” columns.
R6 Units & numbers:
   - Keep native units; when a conversion is required by a step, show both source and computed values.
   - Decimal separator = period “.”; thousands separator = none (e.g., 1,500 → 1500 unless part of quoted text).
   - Significant figures: preserve as printed when quoting; computed values follow each step’s rounding rules.
R7 Dates: MM-DD-YYYY. Times (if any): 24-hour HH:MM with timezone if relevant.
R8 Evidence references must specify location (e.g., “Copy Doc p3 line 12” or “Artwork PDF p2, FOP panel, lower-left”).
R9 Sourcing preference when values conflict:
   - Names & mandatory copy: Copy Doc > Artwork; if unresolved, mark “TBD” and add note in the step’s “Notes/Evidence.”
   - Regulatory data (e.g., INCI ingredients, warnings): follow region rulebooks if present; else Copy Doc precedence.
R10 ZOOM & VERIFY (MANDATORY): Before flagging any text, zoom to ≥200% (up to 400% if needed) and compare character-by-character to the Copy Doc. Verify punctuation, casing, diacritics, line breaks, spacing, and symbol fidelity. For vector art, check live text properties; for raster art, inspect at native resolution. Only record ⚠️/❌ after this pass.
R11 Language handling:
   - If a step requires multi-language alignment, create separate rows per language or a language-pair matrix as specified.
   - Do not auto-translate; only compare what exists in source files.
R12 Region Inference (when not explicit)
   • If “Regions in Scope” is not explicitly stated in any source, infer and label each inferred region with “(inferred)”.
   • Cue priority (highest → lowest):
     1) Regulatory/Responsible-person addresses (e.g., “amika … USA”; “BIORIUS … EU”; “UK: … GB”).
     2) Mandatory language blocks by jurisdiction (e.g., EN/FR for 🇨🇦; EN/DE/FR/ES clusters for 🇪🇺/🇬🇧).
     3) Jurisdictional symbols/marks (EU/UK RP address, market-specific icons).
   • Evidence required: cite the basis in H. Score & Summary “Notes” (e.g., “Copy Doc p3 line 12; Artwork BOP address panel”).
   • If cues conflict or remain ambiguous, set “TBD”.
R13 Table integrity:
   - No blank header rows, no trailing blank rows. Keep text wrapping minimal; if a quote is long, keep it intact.
R14 Screenshots (for Step G): crop tightly, mark with rectangles/arrows, and ensure legibility at 100% display. Assign a unique ID [G-###].
R15 File references: include exact filenames (with extensions) and versions/dates as present in metadata or filenames.
R16 Privacy & IP: redact or omit any confidential internal codes not necessary for verification, unless they are printed on artwork.
R17 Accessibility: when listing icons/symbols, provide a short textual label (e.g., “Leaping Bunny,” “PAO 12M,” “Mobius loop 1”).
R18 Step/Scope Isolation
- Each step and sub-step has its own schema and rules. Do not generalize or carry rules from one step to another.
- When multiple steps touch similar content (e.g., 3A vs 3B), apply only that step's language scope, columns, status logic, and evidence requirements.
- If a step's rules appear to conflict with another step's rules, the step-specific rules prevail for that step (Global Rules still apply universally).
- Output must conform exactly to the current step's table headers, column order, allowed icons, and language scope.
- No inferred carry-overs (e.g., multi-language checks in 3A do not imply multi-language outputs in 3B if 3B is EN-only).

EXECUTION INSTRUCTION (non-output)
- Before rendering each step, validate:
  - Schema match: headers and column order exactly equal to that step's schema.
  - Language scope: enforce step-specific scope (e.g., 3B = EN-only).
  - Icon set: only the status icons allowed by that step.
- If any validation fails, stop and correct before producing output.
- For every step below, apply the relevant Global Rules (R0–R18) internally.
- Do NOT display any rule numbers or references in the user-facing output.

1️⃣ Project Header

| Field | Fill In |
|---|---|
| Project Name | <derived from copy/artwork files only> |
| Round / Version | <as provided; if unknown write “Unspecified”> |
| Regions in Scope | <flags/regions; append “(inferred)” if derived via R12; else “TBD”> |
| Due Date | <MM-DD-YYYY; else “TBD”> |

Helper — Use this exact line for the “Regions in Scope” row:
| Regions in Scope | <flags/regions; append “(inferred)” if derived via R12; else “TBD”> |

Sourcing Hierarchy for Step 1
- Project Name: Copy Doc > Artwork filename > Artwork display name on FOP; else “TBD”.
- Round/Version: Request text, file naming, or visible version notes; else “Unspecified”.
- Regions: If explicit, list them. If not explicit, infer per R12 and label “(inferred)”; if cues conflict/ambiguous, set “TBD” and record evidence in H → Notes.
- Due Date: Request text, tracker, or filename date; else “TBD”.

(Examples are not for output: Regions may be flags like 🇺🇸 🇨🇦 🇪🇺 🇬🇧 or ISO region names if no flags are present.)

2️⃣ Files to Attach

| Type | Filename | Status |
|---|---|---|
| Copy Document | <file.docx/pdf/image> | ✅/❌  |
| Final Artwork (flattened/ai) | <file.pdf/file.ai> | ✅/❌ |

Rules for Step 2
- ❌ if a required file is missing or unreadable; ✅ only when fully correct and accessible.

––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––

A. Copy Quality

| Language | Original Text | Recommendation | Status | Evidence (page/line) |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| EN | <quote exact> | <ready-to-paste fix> | ✅/⚠️/❌ | <p#, line#> |

Rules for Step A
- Begin by reviewing the Copy Document only.
- Check each non-English translation (FR, ES, DE, etc.) against the English line for **semantic accuracy, tone, and completeness**.
- If the translation is **inaccurate**, **incomplete**, or **mismatched in tone**, mark ❌ and recommend a corrected string.
- Only after confirming accuracy in the Copy Document should you check the matching Artwork file.
- Use “✅” if the line is both accurate in the Copy Document **and** matches the Artwork.  
- One row per language for all languages. Do not paraphrase; quote all strings exactly.

––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––

B. Claim Risk

| Language | Claim (quote) | Risk Level | Rationale | Region(s) Impacted | Action | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| EN | “<exact claim>” | Low/Medium/High | <why risky or compliant> | <All/USA/EU/CA/UK/etc.> | Keep/Modify/Remove | ⚠️/❌ |

Rules for Step B
- Quote claims verbatim. Group identical claims; otherwise separate rows.
- Only quote English claims
- Risk Level (triage):
  • Low: Qualifiers present, puffery, commonly accepted claims.
  • Medium: Performance claims implying measurable outcomes without visible substantiation.
  • High: Drug-like/therapeutic claims, superiority claims without substantiation, regulated terms.
- Action: Keep (no change), Modify (add qualifier/footnote), Remove (not permitted).
- If no risky claims, include a single row “No risky claims identified” with ✅.

C. Label-Claim Conversion

| Source | Declared (mL) | Calculated (fl oz) | Declared (fl oz) | Within ±0.10 | Status | Result |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Copy Doc / Artwork | <e.g., 150> | <mL ÷ 29.5735 → 2 decimals> | <as printed> | Yes/No | ✅/❌ | Suggested action item |

Rules for Step C
- Calculated (fl oz) = mL ÷ 29.5735, rounded to 2 decimals (standard rounding; .005 rounds up).
- Tolerance: ±0.10 fl oz. If |Declared − Calculated| > 0.10 → ❌. If ≤ 0.10 → ✅. If Declared missing → ❌.
- Add a separate row for each distinct size/SKU found in BOTH Copy Doc and Artwork. If present in one but not the other, still list with a note.
- If fl oz is printed but mL is missing (or vice versa), compute the missing side and mark ❌ unless both are present and within tolerance.
- Do NOT use grams (G) as part of calculation

Quick-Reference — mL → fl oz (append verbatim)
| mL | Correct fl oz |
|---|---|
| 5 | 0.17 |
| 10 | 0.34 |
| 15 | 0.51 |
| 30 | 1.01 |
| 50 | 1.69 |
| 150 | 5.07 |

D. Artwork Match

| Field | Copy Doc Value | Artwork Value | Match | Notes (panel/page) |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Product Name | <quote> | <quote> | ✅/⚠️/❌ | <FOP/PDP/panel #> |
| Variant/Scent | <quote> | <quote> | ✅/⚠️/❌ |  |
| Net Contents | <quote> | <quote> | ✅/⚠️/❌ |  |
| Usage/Directions | <quote> | <quote> | ✅/⚠️/❌ |  |
| Warnings | <quote> | <quote> | ✅/⚠️/❌ |  |
| Ingredients | <quote> | <quote> | ✅/⚠️/❌ |  |
| Claims/Icons | <list icons + quotes> | <list icons + quotes> | ✅/⚠️/❌ |  |
| Language Blocks | <languages shown> | <languages shown> | ✅/⚠️/❌ |  |
| Address/Distributor | <quote> | <quote> | ✅/⚠️/❌ |  |
| Website/Social | <quote> | <quote> | ✅/⚠️/❌ |  |
| Lot/Batch/PAO/Recycling | <symbols/text> | <symbols/text> | ✅/⚠️/❌ |  |

Rules for Step D
- Match criteria:
  • ✅ Exact text/symbol match (line breaks/soft wraps allowed).
  • ⚠️ Minor formatting/layout variance that does not alter meaning.
  • ❌ Text/symbols differ, missing, or extra.
- Icons: list by common name (e.g., “Leaping Bunny”), confirm presence/absence; include PAO value (e.g., “12M”) if printed.
- Add rows for additional mandatory items by target regions (e.g., “Made in,” recycling codes, allergen statements).

E. Font Size

| Text String / Field | Jurisdiction | Required Min (pt) | Measured Min (pt) | Method | Status | Screenshot ID |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| <e.g., INGREDIENTS> | <USA cosmetics> | 6.0 | <measured> | Vector/Bitmap | ✅/❌ | <G-###> |

Rules for Step E
- Minimum: 6.0 pt (≈ 2.12 mm) for mandatory text unless stricter regional rules apply.
- Measurement:
  • Vector: read font size property from live text.
  • Bitmap/outlined: measure x-height or cap height via pixels-to-pt/mm; document calc if contested.
- Anything < 6.0 pt = ❌. Borderline (e.g., 5.98) = ❌ unless vector evidence proves 6.0+.
- Every ❌ must link to a Step G screenshot with overlay.

––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––

F. Barcode

| Symbology | Encoded Digits | Check Digit Valid | X-Dim (mm) | Quiet Zone (mm) | Module Count | Print Contrast | Scan Test |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| UPC-A / EAN-13 | <digits> | Yes/No | <value> | <value> | <value> | Yes/No | Pass/Fail |

Rules for Step F
- Decode using a standard reader; record EXACT digits (including leading zeros). Human-readable text is implied by digits.
- X-Dim and Quiet Zone must meet symbology standards (e.g., UPC-A quiet zone ≥ 10× module). If unknown, record “TBD” and mark ⚠️ with rationale.
- Print Contrast: “Yes” if high contrast on intended substrate; “No” if low contrast/patterned background.
- Scan Test: Pass only if decoded from representative print or high-quality proof. Digital-only → ⚠️ with note “digital proof only.”
- Include a Step G screenshot of the decode result for any ⚠️/❌.

––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––

G. Visual Snapshots

For every ⚠️ or ❌, add a numbered block exactly as follows:

[G-001]
Screenshot: <paste image here>
Caption — What: <what is wrong>
Caption — Where: <panel/page/coordinates if relevant>
Caption — Fix: <exact correction to make>
Linked Rows: <e.g., D: Product Name; E: Font Size row 2; F: Barcode>
Status After Fix: TBD

Rules for Step G
- Each issue gets its own block with a unique ID in ascending order (G-001, G-002, …).
- Use clear rectangles/arrows; ensure the problem text/symbol is legible.
- If one screenshot supports multiple table rows, list all Linked Rows separated by semicolons.

APPENDIX — QUICK CHECKS & BEST PRACTICES (REFERENCE ONLY; NOT FOR OUTPUT)

A. Quick punctuation & typography triage
- Use true ellipses (…) not three periods (...), true en dash (–) for ranges (e.g., 5–10), true em dash (—) for breaks.
- Smart quotes “ ”, apostrophes ’, trademark ™ and registered ® as per Copy Doc; do not invent symbols.

B. Line breaking
- Soft wraps are acceptable; do not force hyphenation unless artwork shows it. Never change words to fit a line.

C. Ingredient lists
- Preserve order and punctuation exactly. If commas vs semicolons differ between sources, treat as ❌ unless a regional rule dictates otherwise.

D. Icons (common)
- PAO (e.g., “12M”), recycling Mobius loop with/without code, Leaping Bunny/other cruelty-free marks, FSC, e-commerce symbols. Record presence and exact printed values.

E. Screenshot naming (suggested)
- Use pattern: G-###_<step>_<shortdesc>.png (e.g., G-002_FontSize_Ingredients.png).

F. File naming (suggested)
- ProjectName_Size_Version_Date.ext (e.g., un.done-TextureSpray_5.3oz_v2_2025-09-05.pdf).
